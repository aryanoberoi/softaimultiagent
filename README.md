## Documentation

Soft AI, virtual chat-powered company for software
 development, brings together agents including chief officers, professional programmers, test
 engineers, and UI/UX designers. When presented with a preliminary
 task by a human â€œclient, the agents at SoftAI engage in
 effective communication and mutual verification
 through collaborative chatting. This process enables them to
 automatically craft comprehensive
 landing pages that are well designed, tested and satisfy user requirement.
#### Setup

- Flask Setup: The application is built on Flask, a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python, providing tools and features to build web apps quickly.

- MySQL Integration: Utilizes Flask-MySQLdb for database interactions, storing user accounts and managing sessions for authentication.

- Session Management: Uses secret keys to securely manage user sessions, enabling personalized experiences like user authentication and maintaining chat state.

#### Authentication System

- Login Functionality: Processes user login requests, validating credentials against the MySQL database, and managing session data for logged-in users.

- Registration Process: Handles new user registrations, including validation of user inputs and insertion of new accounts into the database.

- Logout Mechanism: Provides users the ability to securely logout, clearing session data to prevent unauthorized access.


#### AI Integration for Chat Simulation

- GPT Assistant Agents: Implements GPT-based AI agents (CTO, Engineer) with specific roles and directives to participate in chat discussions, simulating a real project planning and execution conversation.

- SocketIO for Real-time Communication: Leverages Flask-SocketIO to enable real-time messaging, allowing users and AI agents to interact seamlessly.

- Custom Message Handling: Overrides default message handling to extract and broadcast chat content dynamically, enhancing the chat experience.

#### AI Agents and Group Chats

- GroupChat and GroupChatManager: Orchestrates conversations among multiple participants, including real users and AI agents, enforcing turn-based messaging and chat progression.

- Dynamic Chat Flow: Adjusts the chat flow based on directives, ensuring each participant (CEO, CTO, Engineer) contributes meaningfully to the conversation.

#### Role of Prompt Engineering in Chat Simulation

- Prompt engineering involves crafting specific instructions to guide AI models in generating contextually appropriate responses.

- Implementation of Chat Simulation:
 Each AI agent (CEO, CTO, Engineer) receives tailored instructions that define    their role-specific behaviors and dialogue styles within the chat.

- Directives included in these prompts dictate how each agent should contribute to the conversation, ensuring smooth transitions and maintaining focus.



#### Overview of AutoGen LLM

##### Introduction to AutoGen:

AutoGen is a cutting-edge framework designed for developing LLM (Large Language Models) applications. It enables seamless integration of multiple conversational agents that can autonomously or collaboratively perform complex tasks.
